If you are reading this, you are most likely looking around for the disco
source code. Well, you can stop looking because it isn't in here!

As such, if you are one of the few people who want the source code, you can
check it out of the public Sourceforge Subversion repository from the following
URL:

https://disco.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/disco/trunk

The disco source code provides everything you need to build the library, with
the exception of Java. To get things running, all you need to do is:

 1. svn checkout https://disco.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/disco/trunk disco
 2. cd disco/codebase
 3. ant release

This will create a folder called codebase/dist/disco-version. In this folder
will be all the build artefacts.

This library has been kindly made open source by Calytrix Technologies. Please
refer to the provided licence for use and distribution terms.

Cheers,
Tim Pokorny, CTO, Calytrix Technologies
